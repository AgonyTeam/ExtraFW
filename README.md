# ExtraFW
A small framework I started working on to make agony more "modular" or something like that.
It's based on the code that already is in agony, check the "extrafw-adaption" branch in the main Agony repo for an Agony version where this is used.

## todo
  - [ ] port agony code systems:
    - [ ] CustomCallbacks
    - [ ] CustomPedestals
    - [ ] CustomPickups
    - [ ] CustomUnlocks
    - [ ] DelayedFunctions
    - [ ] SaveData --rework this to work with all mods
    - [ ] SpriteRender
    - [x] TearProjectiles
    - [x] HelperFunctions
    - [x] RoomFairness
  - [x] add a CustomNPCs system
  - [ ] rework systems to use classes and stuff (like customnpcs)
  - [ ] add alphaapi? (probably in main Agony code, not it this framework)
